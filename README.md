Henlo travellers of the internet, or whatever brings you here

I have a large collection of games, I also decided that I should
add these games to a website called price charting: https://www.pricecharting.com/
anyway if you wanna see my collection go here:
https://www.pricecharting.com/offers?seller=tbp3c7qovknxnqfv4p2qlfnyea&status=collection

These guys have API's for getting prices and adding new games to your collection,
however I am currently without employment so I am not going to pay for premium'
for it, so you are able to download your data as a csv. I used Raw JS and HTML
to display my data. Any questions, send me an email scottpenhall98@gmail.com
